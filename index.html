              A huge problem for car and truck owners is managing low tire
              pressure. It can make
              <spna class="color">driving more dangerous,</spna>
              damage your tires, suspension and in some cases other parts of
              your car.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not to mention it can
              <u>increase your risk of being in an accident</u>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will be completely honest, I have been driving a car since i was
              17 years old, and never felt that checking my tires was easy or
              was i comfortable trying to inflate them myself.<u
                >I just knew that i wasnt doing it right</u
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not to mention my husband, who is the handyman that handles these
              things around the house, but even he many times has forgetten to
              check the tires before we head out on a family road trip.
            </p>
            <p>
              You know how it is, when you finally load up all of the kids and
              stuff everything else into the car, we want to be on the road,
              without spending all morning on a car inspection.
            </p>
            <p>
              We should have done the basics like check the oil and
              <a href="#">double check our tire pressure </a>- but we did not.
            </p>
            <h2>I Totally Forgot To Check In Advance</h2>
            <p>
              The whole family decided to jump on the road a couple of months
              ago for an exciting family vacation. Since we live in Texas, we
              were looking to enjoy the nice ocean breeze and a sandy beach in
              Florida!
            </p>
            <p>
              The trip started out fine, my husband took the first half of the
              drive, all of the kids were glued onto their phones and tablets,
              playing games and the usual. The weather was perfect for a road
              trip – and we were all looking forward to relaxing by the pool!
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe around an hour and a half into driving we saw one of those
              warning signs telling us the next stop for gas way far away…
              <u> at the time we had no worries </u> our gas tank was still very
              full.

            <p>
              Not long after that sign, maybe 45 miles, thats when something
              started to happen. My husband has this odd look on his face and
              says:
            </p>
            <p class="color">
              " The car is not handling right, I think our tire has gone flat."
            </p>
            <p>
              I didnt know what to say, remebering the sign from earlier and
              knowing we did not have a spare tire! Thats when I began to panic.

            <div class="div-6">

                We Stopped To Take A Look And It Was Almost Flat - Dangerously

            <p>
              Frustrated , we started to discuss our options. Continuing to
              drive was way too dangerous and we recently canceled AAA after
              having not used it even once in 4 years!
            </p>
            <p>
              We finally decided we should call a tow truck — it seemed like the
              obvious choice. We knew the cost would be over $300 and it would
              take them several hours for the to arrive. But what else could we
              do.
            </p>
            <div class="div-7">
              <p>
                Maybe 10 minutes passes, a kind man close to our age pulled up
                in a Toyota Camry to ask if we needed help.
              </p>
              <p class="color">
                “Hi there, just checking if everything is ok or if you need
                help?”
              </p>
              <p>
                My husband explained that our tire was almost completely flat
                and did not have a spare tire. Because we had a towing service
                on the way, we just told him everything was ok.
              </p>
              <p class="color">
                “Oh! Well, no need to worry, give me a moment and I can help get
                you back on the road.”
              </p>
              <p>
                We had no idea what he was going do get… really, we had no clue.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              When he opened his glove box and pulled out this simple little
              device, the “Airmoto” he referred to it… He saw it online and
              bought one a few months. He’s already used it himself and has
              helped several others as well!
            </p>
            <p>
              He connected it and checked the tire pressure, our tire had
              dropped to a dangerously low 18 PSI now. He was very confident and
              told us to cancel the tow truck, the Airmoto will inflate the tire
              back up to 35psi within minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              That was truly unbelievable,<a href="#"
                >the gadget fit in his hands</a
              >
              and was only about the size of a water bottle… he didn’t have some
              commercial air tank or big machine or anything special, it seemed
              impossible to think this little device would inflate a flattened
              tire, considering the weight of the car was still on the tire.

              Right away, he quickly screwed on the connection very easily
              (never lifting the car), just a click on the power button and the
              Airmoto started working. It sounded just like a powerful air pump
              but only smaller and much quieter. It did appear to be working so
              we just let him continue.<u>In under 5 minutes </u>, he glanced
              our way saying,
            </p>
            <p class="color">
              &nbsp;“That’s it, this tire is ready for the road. Be sure to
              inform the towing company they are no longer needed, you can start
              driving now! Let me go check your other 3 tires just to be sure
              they are good too.”
            </p>
            <p>
              We couldn’t believe it, my husband decided to checked the tire
              multiple times and sure enough, it was at exactly 36 PSI, which is
              what our tires were rated for.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wthin a few more minutes, this kind stranger had checked and
              adjusted every single tire to be exactly 36 PSI. Good thing too
              because the tire on rear passenger side was also quite a bit low
              at 26 PSI until he adjusted it with the Airmoto.
            </p>
            <p>
              After having been stranded, we were FINALLY ready to get back on
              the road and we were so thankful to this stranger and that little
              device, which saved us in an emergency.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as we began driving again, I looked up the product on my
              phone and <u> quickly ordered 3 of them </u>, so we now have one
              in each of our vehicles.

            </p>
            <p>
              It’s a <a href="#">super powerful air pump </a>but so small and

              device, along with several connectors to use for so many different
              items. When you turn it on and connect the air hose to your tire,
